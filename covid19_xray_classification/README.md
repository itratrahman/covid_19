# COVID-19 DETECTION FROM X RAYS
The project under current directory builds and train pretrained resnet50 model for covid-19 detection from x-ray images. The dataset is curated by Dr. Joseph Cohen, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Montreal. We collected the data from the following github repo: https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset. The dataset contains chest xrays from covid-19 patients and normal individuals.

## Folder structure
- `dataset` - contains xray images of both covid19 patients and normal individuals
- `resnet_50_model` - contains jupyter notebook that builds and train pretrained resnet50 model for covid-19 detection
